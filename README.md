* Simulate data acquisition for some analog signals (sine, sawtooth, square, sequence) at desiderable frequencies, amplitudes and offsets.
* Simulate data acquisition for an ECG signal.
* Set the ADC sampling frequency, resolution and voltage levels per channel
* Transmit the samples over Bluetooth
