ADC Simulator
=========

This is a multi-channel ADC samples generator made for testing [Visu](https://github.com/brunoalvarez89/Visu).

![Alt text](https://github.com/brunoalvarez89/Simulador/blob/master/Simulador.png)

With this app you can:
* Simulate data acquisition for some analog signals (sine, sawtooth, square, sequence) at desiderable frequencies, amplitudes and offsets.
* Simulate data acquisition for an ECG signal.
* Create any number of channels and set their sampling frequency, resolution and voltage levels.
* Transmit the samples over Bluetooth.
