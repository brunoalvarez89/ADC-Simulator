# Simulador

Simulador is a multi-channel ADC samples generator made for testing Visu. With this program you can:

* Simulate data acquisition for some analog signals (sine, sawtooth and square waves) at desiderable frequencies, amplitudes and offsets
* Set the ADC sampling frequency, resolution and voltage levels per channel
* Transmit the samples over Bluetooth
